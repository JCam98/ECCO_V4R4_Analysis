# ECCO_V4R4_Analysis
This repository contains python modules and jupyter notebooks that leverage the ECCOv4-py MIT-licensed code repository for loading, wrangling, and analyzing sea-ice and ocean state estimate properties. The contents of this repository are broken up into three general categories according to their end use: 

1) Software specific to the author's manager's (Dr. Patrick Heimbach's) personal use
2) Software to be made accessible to, and used by, the CRIOS group community
3) Software to be adopted by the ECCOv4-py community at-large.
